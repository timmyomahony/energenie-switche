# Energenie Switches

Python scripts for configuring and managing the remote power switches from [Energenie](https://energenie4u.co.uk)

It's worth noting that there are two versions of these that I'm familiar with:

- The older [`ENER002`](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER002-2PI) boards
- Newer `ENER314` "two-way" boards - these have a coil on them.

Code in this repo is split into `v1` for the older boards and `v2` for the newer.
